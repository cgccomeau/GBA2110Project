Welcome to the world's hardest meme, a GT-version of the world's hardest game! Created by Charlie Comeau

The goal of this game is to move the GT logo square from one yellow rectangle to their other while dodging all the moving Georgia logos.
Failure to dodge WILL result in instant death and an infamous picture. To move, use the 4 arrow buttons (up, down, left, right) correspondingly.

Note that the Game Boy START button corresponds to the ENTER key, and you can immediately reset the game from any page by hitting the BACKSPACE key.

When you win, the game will take you to a happy shiba inu and she will help you reset the game to play again.

Note in the real game, your square moves slower than the obstacles, however I highkey suck at that game so for demo and dignity purposes I have made the square to move faster than the obstacles LOL
